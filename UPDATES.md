* Changed value of taxes. Precious items like "pyrite" or "fourrure" weren't profitable enough, so their taxes are less important.

### at 0:55 AM
#### Difficulty increased
* The more items you buy, the more the market prices will be affected.
* Time is important : if you buy a great quantity of one item, his price will tumble down quickly. But with time, his price will increase again (considering the point above).

#### Graphics are more readable
* The graph vertical axis varies with the max price of the item. For example, "clous" can't exceed 40 thorenis/kg, therefore the max height value of the vertical axis will be 40 (and not 1000 like before).
